# Variations of Deep Learning for Cancer Diagnosis Using Gene Expression Data

**Henrique de Almeida Machado da Silveira**

This repository refers to the final project required for obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from University of São Paulo (ICMC/EESC - USP).

The goal of the project was to explore Deep Learning algorithms, using them to analyze gene expression data related to cancer diagnosis. Therefore, I used deep neural networks to classify data and evaluate their performance. A Deep Learning model was also used for dimensionality reduction.

### Structure of the Repository

* [code](https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer/tree/master/code) - All source code used throughout the project is available here
    * [preprocessing](https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer/tree/master/code/preprocessing) contains R scripts used to preprocess data
    * [experimentation](https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer/tree/master/code/experimentation) contains the main Python code used to perform experiments, setting up the neural networks used in this project
    * [analysis](https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer/tree/master/code/analysis) contains the Python script used to extract information from results and analyze data
* [results](https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer/tree/master/results) - The output generated from all experiments and from the analysis is contained here
* [dissertation](https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer/tree/master/dissertation) - The dissertation I wrote can be accessed in here
